## Ethereum Blockchain Lottery
A simple Ethereum based blockchain app I made along with React for the front end. This app makes use of the smart contract I deployed for Blockchain-Lottery on my other repo. 

## How To Use
1) clone or download to your local machine and run npm install for any dependencies </br>
2) play around with the lottery smart contract by adding your own test ether and joining the pool </br>
3) you are the manager! pick the winner of your ether pool and see who wins </br>

**Note** There seems to be an issue with the contract gas running out. I plan on taking a look into this later on.
